How can i call lower_bound on pair<int,int> to get the last occurence of pair if element is repeating ?

For eg :

[7,1,5,3,1,1]

[ {1,1,} , {1,4} , {1,5}, {3,3}, {5,2}, {7,0} ]

if i do lower_bound for should get pair {1,5}
try auto it = st. upper_bound({first+1,-inf})
if(it == st.begin()) element not found
else element in it--



I search it in google , but i can't find it. Can somebody tell me how to use lower_bound in set<pair<int,int>> , so i can find the fist
pair whose first element is not small than the element i search for ?
x.lower_bound({first, -inf});
x.upper_bound({first, inf});
