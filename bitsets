 What is the first set bit.I asked M.Mahdi and he told me about bs._Find_first(). for example:
bitset<17>BS;
BS[1] = BS[7] = 1;
cout<<BS._Find_first()<<endl; // prints 1

After more research , we found bs._Find_next(idx). This function returns first set bit after index idx.for example:
bitset<17>BS;
BS[1] = BS[7] = 1;
cout<<BS._Find_next(1)<<','<<BS._Find_next(3)<<endl; // prints 7,7

So this code will print all of the set bits of BS:
for(int i=BS._Find_first();i< BS.size();i = BS._Find_next(i))
    cout<<i<<endl;
