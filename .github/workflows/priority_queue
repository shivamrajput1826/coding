Priority Queue is similar to queue where we insert an element from the back and remove an element from front, but with a one difference
that the logical order of elements in the priority queue depends on the priority of the elements. The element with highest priority will be
moved to the front of the queue and one with lowest priority will move to the back of the queue. Thus it is possible that when you enqueue
an element at the back in the queue, it can move to front because of its highest priority.
